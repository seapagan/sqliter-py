# SQLiter Local Caching Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing local caching in the SQLiter ORM library. The goal is to reduce database queries by caching results in memory, with the cache being cleared when the database instance is closed.

## 1. Cache Implementation (cache.py)

The Cache class will use a dictionary-based storage system with two main components:

### Primary Storage

- Structure: `Dict[str, CacheEntry]`
- Key: Hash of query parameters
- Value: CacheEntry object containing:
  - Cached data
  - Timestamp of caching
  - TTL (Time To Live)
  - Query metadata (table, fields, filters)

### Secondary Index

- Structure: `Dict[str, set[str]]`
- Key: Table name
- Value: Set of cache keys related to that table
- Purpose: Enables efficient invalidation of all cache entries for a specific table

## 2. Cache Integration (sqliter.py)

### New SqliterDB Parameters

- `enable_cache`: Boolean to toggle caching
- `cache_ttl`: Optional duration for cache entries
- `max_cache_size`: Optional limit on cache size
- `cache_strategy`: Enum for different invalidation strategies

### New Methods

- `clear_cache()`: Clears all cache entries
- `clear_table_cache(table_name)`: Clears cache for specific table
- `get_cache_stats()`: Returns cache hit/miss statistics

### Implementation Details

- Cache initialization only happens if enable_cache is True
- Database operations check cache settings before performing cache operations

## 3. QueryBuilder Cache Integration (query.py)

### Cache Key Generation

- Consider all query components:
  - Table name
  - Selected fields
  - Filter conditions (normalized)
  - Order by clauses
  - Limit and offset values

### Query Execution Flow

1. Generate cache key
2. Check cache for existing valid entry
3. If found and valid, return cached result
4. If not found or invalid, execute query
5. Store result in cache if caching is enabled

### Additional Features

- Cache bypass options for specific queries
- Query-specific cache settings

## 4. Cache Key Generation

### CacheKeyBuilder Class

- Normalizes query components
- Handles different data types consistently
- Creates deterministic string representations
- Uses cryptographic hashing for final key

### Key Components

- Table name
- Sorted list of selected fields
- Normalized filter conditions
- Ordering information
- Pagination details

## 5. Cache Invalidation Strategy

### Multiple Strategy Options

#### Simple Strategy (BasicCacheStrategy)

- Suitable for:
  - Small applications with limited memory
  - Simple CRUD operations
  - When query patterns are straightforward
- Advantages:

- Only invalidate affected cache entries
- Suitable for:
  - Large applications with complex queries

- Implementation Details:
  - Maintain dependency graph between:
    - Tables and their relationships
    - Queries and the data they access
    - Fields used in queries

  - Analyze query patterns for optimization
- Advantages:
  - More efficient cache utilization
  - Better performance for complex queries
  - Reduced unnecessary invalidations
- Disadvantages:
  - More complex implementation
  - Higher memory overhead
  - Requires careful dependency tracking

#### Hybrid Strategy (HybridCacheStrategy)

- Combines aspects of both Simple and Smart strategies
- Uses simple strategy for:
  - Write operations
  - Simple queries
  - When memory pressure is high
- Uses smart strategy for:
  - Read operations
  - Complex queries
  - When resources are available
- Implementation Details:
  - Dynamic switching based on:
    - Current memory usage
    - Query complexity
    - System load
    - Cache hit rates
  - Configurable thresholds for strategy switching
- Advantages:
  - Balance between simplicity and efficiency
  - Adaptable to different workloads
  - Better resource utilization
- Disadvantages:
  - More complex decision logic
  - Requires tuning for optimal performance

#### Time-Based Strategy (TimeCacheStrategy)

- Cache entries expire after a specified time
- Suitable for:
  - Data that becomes stale after a period
  - When absolute consistency is not critical
  - Reducing memory pressure automatically
- Implementation Details:
  - Global TTL setting with per-query overrides
  - Lazy or eager cleanup of expired entries
  - Optional background cleanup thread
- Advantages:
  - Simple to implement and understand
  - Automatic memory management
  - Good for frequently changing data
- Disadvantages:
  - May serve stale data
  - Not optimal for all data types
  - Requires TTL tuning

#### Query-Based Strategy (QueryCacheStrategy)

- Different caching rules based on query types
- Suitable for:
  - Applications with diverse query patterns
  - When different data types need different handling
- Implementation Details:
  - Define rules based on:
    - Query complexity
    - Table relationships
    - Data update frequency
    - Resource requirements
  - Custom invalidation rules per query type
- Advantages:
  - Fine-grained control
  - Optimized for specific query patterns
  - Flexible configuration
- Disadvantages:
  - Complex configuration
  - Requires query analysis
  - Higher maintenance overhead

### Strategy Selection Guidelines

#### Factors to Consider

1. Application Characteristics
   - Data size and complexity
   - Query patterns
   - Update frequency
   - Memory constraints

2. Performance Requirements
   - Response time targets
   - Consistency requirements
   - Resource utilization limits

3. Operational Considerations
   - Maintenance overhead
   - Monitoring requirements
   - Debug capabilities

#### Decision Matrix

| Factor                | Simple  | Smart   | Hybrid  | Time    | Query   |
|----------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Memory Usage         | Low     | High    | Medium  | Low     | Medium  |
| Implementation       | Easy    | Complex | Medium  | Easy    | Complex |
| Maintenance          | Easy    | Hard    | Medium  | Easy    | Hard    |
| Query Optimization   | Basic   | High    | Good    | Basic   | High    |
| Configuration Needed | Minimal | High    | Medium  | Low     | High    |
| Consistency          | High    | High    | High    | Medium  | High    |

#### Strategy Switching

- Support runtime strategy switching
- Implement strategy change without data loss
- Monitor performance metrics to suggest optimal strategy
- Allow hybrid approaches combining multiple strategies

## 6. Update Optimization

### Update Process

1. Fetch current record state
2. Compare with new state field by field
3. Only proceed with update if changes detected

### Optimization Considerations

- Skip comparison for timestamp fields
- Option to force update regardless of changes
- Maintain last_modified tracking for cache validation

### Cache Consistency

- Update cache entries with new data after successful writes
- Option to invalidate instead of update for complex queries

## 7. Configuration Options

### Cache Settings

- `max_size`: Maximum number of cache entries or memory usage
- `ttl`: Default and per-query TTL options
- `strategy`: Cache invalidation strategy selection
- `compression`: Option to compress cached data

### Performance Settings

- `stats_enabled`: Track cache performance metrics
- `debug_mode`: Additional logging for cache operations
- `auto_invalidation`: Control automatic cache clearing

### Query-level Controls

- `cache_enabled`: Override global cache setting for specific queries
- `cache_ttl`: Custom TTL for specific queries
- `bypass_cache`: Force database query regardless of cache

## 8. Memory Management Strategies

### Memory Monitoring

- Track total memory usage of cache
- Implement soft and hard memory limits
- Monitor memory pressure and adjust cache behavior

### Eviction Policies

- Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction
- Time-based expiration
- Priority-based retention (keep frequently accessed items)
- Memory pressure-based cleanup

### Memory Optimization

- Compress cached data when possible
- Store minimal representations of query results
- Implement reference counting for shared data
